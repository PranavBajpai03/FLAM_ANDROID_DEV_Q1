# â™› N-Queens Solver

This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic **N-Queens problem** using **backtracking**.

The N-Queens puzzle is the problem of placing `n` chess queens on an `n x n` chessboard so that no two queens attack each other. This means no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

## ðŸ’¡ Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle. Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where `'Q'` and `'.'` indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.

### Example:
**Input**: `n = 4`  
**Output**:
